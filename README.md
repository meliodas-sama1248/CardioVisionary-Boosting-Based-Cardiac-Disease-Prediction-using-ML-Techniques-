# ❤ CardioVisionary: Boosting-Based Cardiac Disease Prediction using ML Techniques

*CardioVisionary* is a machine learning-based heart disease prediction system that helps in early diagnosis and preventive care. Powered by Gradient Boosting and other robust ML models, this project uses health parameters like age, cholesterol, and blood pressure to predict heart disease risk with high accuracy.
